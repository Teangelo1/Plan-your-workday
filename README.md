#Plan You Work Day

Goal: Dynamically update HTML & CSS code to Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day using jQuery.

##Developer Teangelo Burks

**Criteria for calendar application**

* Moment.js libary to always show current time on the page.
&nbsp;

* Based on the hour of the day. The calendar will update with a specific color. 
&nbsp;

* The Calendar input blocks will need a different color based on the past, present, and future hours of the day.
&nbsp;

* Once the user inputs an event in a specific time slot, the event is saved in local storage once the save button is pressed.
&nbsp;

* Once saved in local storage. If the users refreshes the page, the event entered will still persist

**What exactly will the user experience look like?**
